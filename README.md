# Entanglement-Distance
Convert entanglement to edge weights/distances
---
This will take a quantum surface code/circuit with arbitrary controlled-U gates and then
compute the operator norm distance from each controlled-U to a CNOT gate. This distance will be normalized and converted
to and edge weight on a graph describing the entanglement of the qudits effectively converting entanglement
measures into Euclidean or conformal distances in an entangled system of qudits/particles.
